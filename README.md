# Steppy

### What is Steppy?
Steppy is a lightweight, open-source, Python 3 library for fast and reproducible experimentation. It lets data scientist focus on data science not on software development issues. Minimal interface does not impose constraints, however, enables clean pipeline design and reproducible data science.

### What problem steppy solves?

### Start using steppy
#### Installation
Steppy requires `python3.5` or above.
```bash
pip3 install steppy
```
_(you probably want to install it in your [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/#))_

You can also clone the repository directly:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minerva-ml/steppy.git
```

### Roadmap
At this point steppy is early-stage library heavily tested on multiple machine learning challenges ([data-science-bowl](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-data-science-bowl-2018 'Kaggle's data science bowl 2018'), [toxic-comment-classification-challenge](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-toxic-comments 'Kaggle's Toxic Comment Classification Challenge'), [mapping-challenge](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-mapping-challenge 'crowdAI's Mapping Challenge')) and educational projects ([minerva-advanced-data-scientific-training](https://github.com/minerva-ml/minerva-training-materials 'minerva.ml -> advanced data scientific training')).

We are developing steppy towards practical tool for data scientists who can run their experiments easily and change their pipelines with just few manipulation in the code.
